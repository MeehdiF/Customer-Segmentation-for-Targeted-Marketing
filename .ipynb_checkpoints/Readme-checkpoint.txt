By categorizing customers into distinct groups, businesses can implement targeted marketing strategies that cater to the unique preferences and behaviors of each segment.

Features

 • Data Preprocessing: Cleans the data by handling missing values and encoding categorical variables, preparing it for clustering analysis.
 • K-Means Clustering: Applies the K-Means algorithm to classify customers into meaningful groups based on similarities in their attributes.
 • Visualization: Provides both 2D and 3D visualizations of clusters to give clear insights into customer segments and their characteristics.

Dataset

The project uses the Customer Segmentation dataset from Kaggle, which includes information on customer demographics and purchasing behavior.
